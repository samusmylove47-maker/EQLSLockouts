// EQLS Lockouts — parsing core.
//
// Pure. No `require` of anything at all. No Electron, no DOM, no filesystem,
// no timers, and `Date.now()` is never called in this file. Lines in, an
// explicit `now` in, JSON-clonable state out.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR
//
// EverQuest Legends does not print a raid lockout line. We checked: see
// docs/EVIDENCE.md. What it *does* print is a weekly task, by name, on the
// kill:
//
//   You have been assigned the task 'Potential of the Void - Lord Nagafen - Weekly'.
//   Your task 'Potential of the Void - Lord Nagafen - Weekly' has been updated.
//   You have been given: Void-Touched Potential
//
// Every other tool that ships this feature infers a lockout from kill history
// and hardcodes a reset day. This module does neither. It records what the
// game said and when, and reports the reset boundary as the *bracket* the
// observations actually support — never as a constant.
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE
//
// No reset day is hardcoded. `projectReset()` returns `provenance: 'not
// recorded'` until two assignments of the same task have been observed on
// opposite sides of a turnover. There is no default. There is no fallback
// constant. If you are tempted to add one, read docs/EVIDENCE.md first: the
// only two published implementations of this feature both ship a typed
// Tuesday, and one of them marks it "VERIFY IN GAME" in its own source.
//
// TIME, AND WHY IT IS AWKWARD ON PURPOSE
//
// A log stamp is `[Mon Aug 10 17:14:49 2026]`. It carries no timezone and no
// UTC offset. It is the game client's local wall clock, nothing more. This
// module therefore works entirely in *civil time* and refuses to produce an
// instant. `civilOf()` returns a monotone integer for differencing only; it is
// not an epoch and must not be displayed or persisted as one.
//
// The known cost, stated rather than hidden: across a daylight-saving
// transition, a civil difference is off by the size of the shift. `CAVEAT_DST`
// is attached to every interval this module reports. `crossesPossibleDstShift`
// is emitted on each bracket and is **always null**, because this module has no
// timezone and therefore genuinely cannot decide it — the field exists so a
// host that DOES know its zone can fill it in, not because we computed it.

// ===========================================================================
// THE CONTRACT
// ===========================================================================
//
// Everything below is a promise to the host application. Six of these came from
// Session C, who read a real Electron log-parsing app and listed what a retrofit
// module has to satisfy. They are written here rather than only in the code that
// satisfies them, because a constraint honoured in one function and undocumented
// is a constraint the next edit breaks.
//
// 1. INPUT IS THE RAW LINE, PREFIX AND ALL.
//    Give this module exactly what the tailer emits:
//        [Wed Aug 19 19:17:52 2026] You say, 'danger'
//    Do NOT strip the timestamp first. Host parsers commonly strip it as their
//    first step; here the timestamp IS the measurement, and a stripped line
//    parses to null rather than failing loudly. Lines the module does not model
//    are ignored, so it is safe to feed it everything.
//
// 2. THE CLOCK IS NEVER READ. `now` IS THE ONLY TIME SOURCE.
//    No `Date.now()`, no `new Date()`, no timers, no intervals in this file.
//    Stronger, and this is the property that matters: **`now` does not affect
//    accumulated state at all.** `applyLine` never sees it. It is an argument to
//    `project()` only, where it feeds derived views like `hoursAgo`. So replaying
//    a million lines produces byte-identical state to receiving them live, and a
//    test asserts it.
//
// 3. ONE-SECOND RESOLUTION, AND NO ORDERING WITHIN A SECOND.
//    The log stamps to the second. Two events sharing a stamp arrive in an order
//    the log does not guarantee, and **nothing in this module may depend on that
//    order.**
//
//    This is not theoretical. Two sessions on this project were bitten by it
//    independently, in different codebases: Session C by a mez break and its
//    wear-off sharing a stamp, and this module by the Voidling's closing line
//    arriving BEFORE the task line it was being used to terminate:
//
//        [Tue Aug 11 20:40:44 2026] You say, 'danger'
//        [Tue Aug 11 20:40:44 2026] Voidling says, 'Your hubris risks our very reality itself.'
//        [Tue Aug 11 20:40:44 2026] You have been assigned the task '... Lady Vox - Weekly'.
//
//    That produced a false reset bracket from a granted task read as a refusal. The fix was structural, not a patch: `applyLine` classifies
//    nothing. It records raw observations, and `classifyRequests` decides later
//    with the whole window visible. **Any future logic that asks "did A happen
//    before B" must instead ask "did A and B both happen within N seconds".**
//
// 4. STATE IS JSON, AND ONLY JSON.
//    No Map, Set, Date, function, undefined, Infinity or NaN ever enters state.
//    Those survive every unit test and silently empty or corrupt on the first
//    reload. State is plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and null,
//    so `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(state))` is exact. A test asserts the round
//    trip is deep-equal.
//
// 5. NO FILE IS OWNED, NO DEFAULT IS OWNED.
//    This module never reads or writes anything. It has no config file, no
//    persistence, and no opinion about where state lives. It hands back a plain
//    object; the host owns defaults, backfill and migration, because that
//    ownership living in one place is what lets a host change its schema without
//    a migration.
//
// 6. FEEDING THE SAME LINE TWICE IS SAFE. IT IS IDEMPOTENT.
//    Stated plainly because "undecided is what hurts": a tailer that re-reads a
//    tail, a backfill that overlaps the live stream, or the same file arriving
//    twice under different names all produce **no change in state**. Every
//    observation is keyed by (timestamp, kind, identity) and a repeat increments
//    `dropped.duplicate` instead of being recorded. A test feeds the fixture
//    twice and asserts the state is deep-equal to feeding it once.
//
//    Verified by diff, not by assertion: replaying the whole stream changes
//    exactly ONE key in the entire state object — `dropped.duplicate`, the
//    counter recording how many repeats were rejected. That counter is supposed
//    to move. Nothing else does.
//
//    Voidling replies are the one thing NOT stored as an event. They are a set
//    of SECONDS, because one NPC answers several players at once and prints two
//    lines per exchange, so a list would grow on replay. An earlier revision
//    exempted them from dedupe and called it a deliberate exception; the
//    CONTRACT 6 test proved that broke idempotence, and the exception is gone.
//    Presence is all they are for, and a set is idempotent by construction.
//
//    THAT SET IS BOUNDED, AND HERE IS THE BOUND. It holds at most MAX_EVENTS
//    (5,000) distinct seconds, oldest dropped first. A set with no bound is a
//    leak in a page the owner is asked to leave open all evening, and "it is a
//    set so it cannot grow" is only true of repeats — distinct seconds keep
//    arriving as long as the client is running. At one Voidling exchange per
//    second sustained, 5,000 seconds is about 83 minutes of continuous hailing;
//    in real play the corpus produces 195 replies across three weeks. The cost
//    of the bound is that a refusal older than the 5,000th most recent Voidling
//    second loses its positive control and degrades to `unknown` — the safe
//    direction, never to a false lockout.
//
// 7. ONE STATE PER CHARACTER. THE CHARACTER IS AN INPUT.
//    `createState(character)` requires the name and refuses to be shared.
//
//    **THIS IS A CLAIM ABOUT OUR DATA, NOT ABOUT THE GAME.** An earlier revision
//    of this comment argued the lockout is "per character, not per account". An
//    adversarial pass refuted that unanimously, and the fact that kills it is in
//    our own logs:
//
//        eqlog_Avenrae_rivervale.txt      Your total time entitled on this account is approximately 0 years, 12 days.
//        eqlog_Shara_rivervale_*.txt      Your total time entitled on this account is approximately 0 years, 9 days.
//
//    **Two different values means two different accounts.** So the fact that
//    Avenrae and Shara each received their own grant of the same task, seconds
//    apart at the same Voidling, says NOTHING about per-character versus
//    per-account — two accounts would each get a grant under either rule. The
//    observation had no power to distinguish them and should never have been
//    offered as though it did.
//
//    Worse, the hedge attached to it said "the logs do not say which". The logs
//    say exactly which, in the game's own /played output, and nobody had
//    searched. That is a clearance asserted without a string, which is the fault
//    this project exists to catch.
//
//    **The real reason for per-character state is operational and sufficient:**
//    a log file belongs to one character, a host tailer follows whichever file
//    changed last and therefore hops between them, and merging two characters'
//    observation streams fabricates measurements. Not hypothetically — the first
//    version of this module reported a FOUR-SECOND reset bracket built from
//    Avenrae's grant at 17:14:49 and Shara's at 17:14:53.
//
//    Whether the game scopes lockouts per character or per account is
//    **not recorded**, and settling it needs two characters on ONE account,
//    which this corpus does not contain.

//
// Five bosses × five difficulty tiers = 25 cells, one completion per tier per
// week. Supplied first-hand by the owner, 23 Aug 2026.
//
// KEYED ON THE GAME'S STRING; the owner's wording is a display label only. That
// split is not tidiness — **an unmatched roster row and a genuinely uncompleted
// raid render identically**, so a typo here would show an empty row forever and
// look exactly like the thing this tracker exists to warn about. Three of the
// five needed correcting against real data:
//
//   owner wrote     game writes
//   Innoruuk    ->  Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate
//   Cazic Thule ->  Cazic-Thule                     (hyphen; "Cazic Thule" returns 0)
//   Vox / Nagafen / Yael                            exact
//
// A test asserts every key matches at least one boss string seen in real data,
// so a typo fails the build instead of rendering as an empty row.
// THE WEEKLY TASK IS NOT PER BOSS. It is the first three raids of the week.
//
// The owner, first-hand, 23 Aug 2026:
//
//   "Potential of the Void — these are only given to the player for the first 3
//    raids you complete each week. You may only ever carry 3 of them."
//
// **This overturns a reading I published an hour earlier.** Our corpus contains
// weekly tasks for only Lady Vox, Lord Nagafen and Master Yael, and I reported
// that as a property of those bosses — that Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule "have no
// Voidling weekly". Wrong. Those three are simply the raids that happened to be
// done first in the weeks we hold. Any raid can carry the task; only the first
// three in a week do.
//
// Measured, and it fits exactly. Per character, per week beginning Tuesday:
//
//   Avenrae, week of 11 Aug:  18 roster boss kills, 3 task grants, 3 tokens
//   Shara,   week of 11 Aug:  16 roster boss kills, 3 task grants, 3 tokens
//   Both, week of 4 Aug:       7 roster boss kills, 3 task grants, 3 tokens
//
// Eighteen raids, three tokens. The cap is on the token, not on the boss.
//
// TWO CONSEQUENCES, and both matter more than the correction itself:
//
// 1. A REFUSED VOIDLING HAIL MEANS "YOU HAVE USED YOUR THREE THIS WEEK", NOT
//    "THIS BOSS IS LOCKED". Every refusal in our corpus follows three grants in
//    the same week. The refusal is a signal about the CAP, and reading it as a
//    per-boss lockout would be wrong.
//
// 2. THE 25-CELL GRID AND THE TOKEN CAP ARE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. The grid tracks
//    one completion per boss per tier per week — the owner's model, 25 cells.
//    The token tracks the first three raids of the week — one counter, three
//    deep. A boss can be open on the grid while the token cap is spent, and the
//    module must never let one answer the other.
//
// `weeklyTask` below therefore records only what our corpus HAPPENED to observe,
// and is not a claim about the boss.
const WEEKLY_TASK_IS_PER_BOSS = false;
// ===========================================================================
// THE ROW IS THE RAID, NOT THE BOSS
// ===========================================================================
//
// A player decides whether to *run Plane of Fear*. They do not decide whether
// to kill Cazic-Thule. So the row is labelled by what you RUN and names what it
// CONTAINS, and there is still exactly one cell per tier.
//
// This was five boss rows until the alt+Z window showed a single Plane of Fear
// run producing lockout rows for FIVE bosses at once, and a Plane of Hate run
// for TWO. Five cells moving in lockstep would be noise; worse, a row reading
// "Cazic Thule" when it means "the Plane of Fear raid" makes the player learn
// which boss we happened to pick to stand for the zone.
//
// Where the raid holds one boss — Vox, Nagafen, Yael — the boss name IS the
// right label and nothing changes for it.
//
// **THE ASSUMPTION UNDERNEATH, STATED BECAUSE IT IS ONE.**
//
// One cell per raid is correct only if the bosses inside a raid SHARE a lock.
// The alt+Z window is CONSISTENT with that and does not prove it: those bosses
// appeared together after runs that took them together, which is equally what
// five separate locks started at the same moment would look like.
//
// **If they ever diverge, one cell would hide it.** A player who killed Terror
// but not Cazic-Thule would see one cell, and the cell cannot be half true. The
// observation that would separate the two models is a run that clears SOME of a
// zone's bosses, followed by evidence about the others — and whether our corpus
// holds one is recorded in docs/EVIDENCE.md rather than assumed here.
//
// This is the same shape as the kill-stamping caveat: the model is the best fit
// to what we have seen, and the thing it would fail to show is named.
//
// FOUR THINGS THE CORPUS SAYS ABOUT THIS LIST THAT THE alt+Z WINDOW DID NOT.
// Measured across 16 files, 6.3M lines, 93 kills of the ten named bosses.
//
// 1. **EVERY ONE OF THOSE KILLS WAS IN A `- Group N` INSTANCE.** Zero in the
//    bare `Zone N` raid shape, zero in the open world — and the raid shape of
//    these zones DOES occur in the logs (14 Fear visits, 5 Hate visits) without
//    producing a single one of them. So "raid" here is the owner's word for the
//    activity, not the client's word for the instance shape, and nothing in this
//    module should key on the shape believing otherwise.
//
// 2. **THE PLANE OF HATE LIST IS INCOMPLETE FOR THE RAID SHAPE.** Ten further
//    bosses from raids-measured.json die inside Plane of Hate instances — but
//    only in the bare `Zone N` shape, and Innoruuk and the Maestro appear only
//    in `- Group N`. The two shapes hold different populations. The alt+Z window
//    was taken after Group-shape runs, so it could only ever have shown these
//    two. **A Hate row built from that window describes the group instance and
//    not the raid instance**, and that is not yet decided anywhere.
//
// 3. **THE PLANE OF FEAR LIST IS COMPLETE AT FIVE.** The only other candidate,
//    Phoboplasm, fails on its own evidence: it is absent from
//    raids-measured.json and dies up to FIVE times in one visit, where each of
//    the five dies exactly once per visit. A lockout boss dies once.
//
// 4. **`singleBoss` WAS FALSE FOR TWO OF THE THREE, and is now measured.**
//    The owner's alt+Z window lists FOUR bosses under Nagafen's Lair. The
//    corpus agrees independently. Counting group visits and asking which mobs
//    die EXACTLY ONCE ON EVERY VISIT — the signature that separates a lockout
//    boss from trash that always spawns:
//
//      Nagafen's Lair, 15 group visits
//        King Tranix 14/15 · Lord Nagafen 14/15 · Magus Rokyl 14/15
//        Warlord Skarlon 12/15
//        (a fire giant warrior is also 14/15 — but up to SIXTEEN per visit)
//
//      The Permafrost Caverns, 12 group visits
//        Lady Vox 12/12 · Giant wooly spider 12/12 · A priest of Nagafen 12/12
//        an ice giant diplomat 10/12
//        (an ice giant is also 12/12 — but up to SEVEN per visit)
//
//    "Killed on every visit" alone is worthless; it is universality PLUS
//    exactly-one-per-visit that discriminates, and the trash above shows why.
//
//    **A PRIEST OF NAGAFEN WAS HIDING BEHIND ITS ARTICLE.** Nobody had named
//    it, in the window or in any order, and it carries Lady Vox's exact
//    signature. It is the same trap as `a dracoliche`: the leading article
//    reads as trash and is not.
//
//    ~~"Only The Ruins of Old Paineel is genuinely single: all seven of its
//    group visits killed Master Yael and nothing else."~~ **THE SECOND HALF IS
//    FALSE.** Over 25 group visits Paineel also kills an elemental channeler
//    (20/25), a flighty fiend (17/25) and an elemental warrior (7/25). Master
//    Yael is the only mob at 25/25, so Paineel is single-REQUIRED-boss — but
//    "and nothing else" was a claim I never measured.
//
// 5. **THERE IS A THIRD KILL-LINE SHAPE AND THIS MODULE DOES NOT PARSE IT.**
//    `<Name> died.` — 47 lines across the 16 files, 8 of them inside a
//    `- Group` instance. It is NOT parsed, and that is a decision rather than
//    an oversight: the shape covers player and pet deaths as well as mob
//    deaths. `Shara died.` and `Avenrae died.` are both in it, so reading it as
//    a kill line would score the owner's own death as a boss kill.
//
//    **It touches none of the ten roster bosses** — searched all 16 files for
//    every roster spelling in a `died.` line and got zero — so the grid is
//    unaffected today. Where it DOES matter is the roster question above:
//    Warlord Skarlon and an ice giant diplomat each die twice in this shape,
//    which is most of the gap between their counts and 15/15 and 12/12.
//    Parsing it safely needs a way to tell a mob death from a player death,
//    and we do not have one yet.
//
// **NOT A DISCOVERED ROSTER, AND DELIBERATELY NOT YET.** A tracker that learns
// its raids from observed timer rows beats one that ships a list — but if
// `/dzlisttimers` logs, the roster discovers itself for free and anything built
// now is thrown away. This list is the interim, and it is small on purpose.
const RAIDS = Object.freeze([
  // TWO LISTS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME LIST.
  //
  //   `bosses`   COMPLETION KEYS. Killing any one of these marks the cell done.
  //   `alsoDies` measured to die exactly once on (nearly) every group visit,
  //              and NOT used to complete anything.
  //
  // The split is the whole of my answer to "the roster ships as single-boss".
  // It is wrong that these zones hold one boss — the window says four and the
  // corpus agrees. But **promoting them to completion keys can only fail in the
  // dangerous direction.** Lord Nagafen already dies on every visit where
  // Tranix does, so adding Tranix buys nothing; the one case it changes is a
  // group that kills Tranix and then WIPES on Nagafen, where the tool would
  // report the raid done and the player would miss it. That is precisely the
  // failure this tool exists to prevent.
  //
  // So they are recorded, named in the tooltip, and inert — until the
  // shared-lock question is settled by an alt+Z reading for these zones.
  // **Director: promoting `alsoDies` to `bosses` is a one-line change and it
  // is yours, not mine.**

// The owner's alt+Z "Instance Information" window, screenshotted 25 Aug 2026
// after four raid runs, shows the state we had concluded the client never
// exposes. It lists 36 "Outstanding Instance Timers" in three columns —
// Lockout Time, Instance Name, Event Name — and it separates three things this
// module had every reason to confuse:
//
//   1. THE WEEKLY TASK — `Potential of the Void - <Boss> - Weekly`, the
//      Void-Touched Potential token, capped at the first three raids of the
//      week, resetting on a WEEKDAY BOUNDARY (Tuesday). See RESET_RULE.
//
//   2. THE INSTANCE LOCKOUT — 28 rows whose Event Name is a boss name, each
//      reading 5d:23h:58m:5s. A SIX-DAY ROLLING TIMER from when it is taken.
//      There is no weekday and no boundary. See LOCKOUT_MODEL.
//
//   3. THE REPLAY TIMER — 8 rows whose Event Name is literally "Replay Timer",
//      reading 0d:0h:58m. About an hour, and it governs RE-ENTRY, not loot.
//      See REPLAY_MODEL. This is almost certainly the origin of the "rolling
//      18 hours" fan claim this project could never place, and it must never
//      leak into a lockout cell.
//
// **THE SEPARATION IS THE FINDING.** Under pressure to reconcile them, this
// module recorded that "the loot lockout may still be a different object from
// the weekly task and I am not merging them". The window shows both, side by
// side, with different periods and different anchors.
//
// AND OUR OWN NEGATIVE EVIDENCE BRACKETS IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE. We measured
// that any cycle up to 5.78 days was refuted — a weekly still refused on the
// 5.78th day. Six days clears that by about five hours. A measurement made
// without seeing this window and a window read without seeing that measurement
// agree, which is the strongest corroboration this project has produced.

// OBJECT 2 — the instance loot lockout. A ROLLING TIMER, not a weekday.
//
// WHAT THE WINDOW ACTUALLY DETERMINES, and it is less than I first claimed.
//
// Two readings, one moment:
//     replay remaining  0d0h58m05s  =      3,485 s
//     boss   remaining  5d23h58m05s =    518,285 s
//
// Call the periods R and B and the elapsed time E. Then R − E = 3485 and
// B − E = 518285. **Two equations, three unknowns.** Subtracting them cancels E
// entirely:
//
//     B − R = 514,800 s = EXACTLY 5 days 23 hours
//
// **That difference is the measurement.** It is exact, it is a clean whole
// number, and it holds for every possible elapsed time — nothing was assumed to
// get it.
//
// **The absolute periods are NOT determined, and an earlier revision of this
// comment said they were.** It claimed the two timers "solve each other" and
// that six days "falls out". They do not and it does not: six days is the
// answer *if* the replay period is one hour, and every other plausible replay
// period is equally self-consistent to the second —
//
//     R = 1h   → E = 115 s     → B = 6d 0h 0m
//     R = 90m  → E = 1,915 s   → B = 6d 0h 30m
//     R = 2h   → E = 3,715 s   → B = 6d 1h 0m
//     R = 3h   → E = 7,315 s   → B = 6d 2h 0m
//
// The claim that no other pairing gives a whole number was simply false. An
// adversarial pass caught it, and the fault is the one this project keeps

// WHAT REMAINS, NOT WHAT IS DONE. The owner's reason for wanting this is worth
// keeping in front of whoever edits it:
//
//   "we humans experience our own form of compression drift, and only remember
//    that we've done some of those raids, not precisely which ones... The
//    tracker becomes the human safeguard against forgetting to complete raids
//    by the reset deadline."
//
// So the open cells lead and the completed ones recede. A grid that foregrounds
// completions is a scoreboard; this is a checklist of what is still owed.
//
// FIVE CELL STATES. The distinction between the last two is the whole point,
// and `conditional` is the one that stops the tool being useless:
//
//   completed    a kill observed at that difficulty since the last reset
//   available    no kill since the reset, AND coverage spans the whole period
//   conditional  a kill at that difficulty ON THE BOUNDARY DAY. Which side of
//                the turnover it fell is unknowable because the reset HOUR has
//                never been measured — but the instant that decides it IS
//                known, so the cell carries it: "completed if the reset fell at
//                or before 22:37:12, still open if it fell after".
//   unknown      evidence exists that cannot be assigned to this cell at all —
//                a kill at a difficulty the game did not state
//   not_looked   coverage does not span the period — fresh install, no backfill
//
// **`conditional` was `unknown` until 26 Aug 2026, and that cost us the tool.**
// The owner ran the shipped build after a week of raiding and got "0 of 25 done
// · 15 uncertain". Every one of those cells knew the exact instant that decided
// it and said nothing. A refusal to guess is right; a refusal to help is not,
// and they are not the same refusal.
//
// **`not_looked` must never render as `available`.** "I have not looked" and
// "you have not done it" are the same picture and different facts, and a fresh
// install showing 25 available cells would have told the user a comfortable lie.
//
// NO COUNTDOWN. `available` is a state, never a time. The owner asked for no
// countdown and the module could not honestly produce one anyway: the reset
// hour is not recorded.

  //
  // An earlier revision of this comment asserted that a gap in the log means
  // the client was not running, so no raid happened in it. **The owner told us

  // during exactly such a gap.** So the assumption is false, and it was the
  // load-bearing one: a gap can hide a raid that really happened.
  //
  // The module cannot tell "not playing" from "not logging" — nothing in the

  // the safe direction, but it is an assumption presented as a fact, and this
  // module does not do that.
  //
  // So: evaluate BOTH, and where they disagree, SAY WHICH WAY EACH ONE FALLS.
  //
  // An earlier revision collapsed the disagreement to a bare `unknown`, and the
